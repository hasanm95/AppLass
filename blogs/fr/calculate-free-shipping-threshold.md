Free shipping is the #1 incentive for online shoppers. In fact, 75% of consumers expect free shipping on orders under $50.

But if you offer free shipping on everything, you put your profitability at risk. The secret is to set a **free shipping threshold** that nudges customers to add "one more item" to their cart, increasing your Average Order Value (AOV).

## The Mathematical Logic: Finding Your Optimal Number

Don't guess. You need to calculate a threshold that covers your shipping costs while remaining psychologically reachable for the customer.

**The Formula:**
`Threshold = (Average Shipping Cost / Gross Margin) + Average Order Value`

### Example:

- **Average Order Value (AOV):** $40
- **Average Shipping Cost:** $8
- **Gross Margin:** 40% (0.40)

### Calculation:

1. Divide the shipping cost by the margin: $8 / 0.40 = $20
2. Add to the average order value: $20 + $40 = $60

Your threshold should be set at **$60**.
At this level, the additional profit generated by the upsell fully covers the shipping costs.

## Gamifying the Customer Experience

Once your threshold is defined (e.g., $60), you need to make it visible. Don't hide it in a terms and conditions page. Use a **progressive free shipping bar**.

- **Step 1:** The customer adds a $40 product to their cart.
- **Dynamic Update:** *"Only $20 more to get free shipping!"*
- **Psychology:** This activates the **Goal Gradient Effect** — people accelerate their behavior as they get closer to a goal.
