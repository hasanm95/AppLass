Prompt: Premium Landing Page Construction for ScreenVeil
Objective: Create a high-converting, SEO-optimized landing page for the Android utility app "ScreenVeil: Screen Off Video." The design must reflect a "Privacy-First" and "Minimalist" aesthetic, specifically targeting OLED/AMOLED power users.

1. SEO & Metadata Configuration
   Page Title: ScreenVeil: Save 60% Battery with Screen Off Video Playback

Meta Description: The ultimate AMOLED battery saver. Watch YouTube, Netflix, and podcasts with your screen off. Zero permissions, 100% privacy. Download ScreenVeil for Android.

Target Keywords: black screen video, AMOLED battery saver, screen off playback, YouTube background audio, OLED efficiency, screen overlay utility.

Schema Markup: Implement SoftwareApplication and FAQPage JSON-LD. Use "Utility" as the category and "Android" as the OS.

2. Page Sections & Content
   Section 1: Hero (Above the Fold)
   Headline: Listen to Video with Your Screen Off.

Sub-headline: Save over 60% battery on AMOLED devices. ScreenVeil overlays a pure black layer so you can enjoy YouTube, podcasts, and music without the battery drain or accidental touches.

CTA Button: (Use official badge).

Visual: A high-quality mockup showing a smartphone with a vibrant video playing, partially covered by the "ScreenVeil" black overlay and the floating action button.

Section 2: The Core Problem (Pain Points)
Copy: Stop wasting energy. Modern screens are the #1 battery drainer. When you stream video just for the audio, you're burning through your charge for pixels you aren't even watching.

Key Triggers:

Battery Anxiety? Save 50-80% power on OLED/AMOLED panels.

Accidental Touches? Lock your screen in your pocket without stopping the stream.

Section 3: Feature Grid (Iconography-Driven)
Floating Quick Access: A draggable, one-tap button that stays accessible over any app.

Pure Black Overlay: Specifically engineered for AMOLED/OLED screens where black pixels consume zero power.

Smart Unlock System: Simple "Touch to Reveal" controls to prevent ghost taps in your pocket.

Real-Time Clock: View the time and date even while the screen is "off".

Universal Compatibility: Seamlessly works with YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, and any media player.

Section 4: The Technical Advantage (GEO-Ready Stats)
Headline: The Physics of Battery Conservation.

Body Content: On OLED and AMOLED displays, each pixel is its own light source. By displaying "True Black," ScreenVeil instructs pixels to turn completely off. Research shows this can reduce display-related power draw by up to 63% at max brightness.

Visual: A simple diagram comparing LCD (always-on backlight) vs. AMOLED (individual pixels turning off).

Section 5: Privacy Commitment
Headline: Zero Permissions. Total Privacy.

Copy: Unlike clones, ScreenVeil requires no internet access and no personal data. We only need the "Overlay" permission to function. Your data stays on your device—where it belongs.

Section 6: User Testimonials
Quote 1: "Perfect for those who have a phone with low battery and want to listen to podcasts on YouTube." — Reddit User.

Quote 2: "Finally, a simple utility that does one thing really well without complex setup or ads." — Early Adopter.

Section 7: SEO FAQ
Q: Does ScreenVeil work on LCD screens?

A: Yes, it acts as a screen dimmer, but the maximum battery savings are achieved on AMOLED/OLED displays where pixels physically turn off.

Q: How is this different from YouTube Premium?

A: ScreenVeil is a universal hardware-level utility. It works across all apps (Netflix, Prime, etc.) and provides a "pocket mode" that prevents accidental touches while the video continues.

3. Design Styles & UX
   Color Palette: "Amoled Dark" (#000000 background). Accent color: Electric Blue or OLED Green (#00FF00) for buttons to symbolize energy/efficiency.

Typography: Sans-serif, modern, and high-readability (e.g., Inter or Roboto).

Animation: Subtle fade-ins for text. Use a "pulse" effect on the CTA button to draw focus.

Mobile-First: Ensure the page loads in under 2 seconds. Use optimized .webp images to satisfy Google's First Contentful Paint (FCP) requirements.

4. Conversion Focus
   Sticky Footer: A persistent "Download Now" button for mobile users scrolling through features.

Social Proof: Mention "10,000+ Downloads" and "5.0 Star Rating" prominently.
