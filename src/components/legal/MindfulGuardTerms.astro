    1. Acceptance of Protocol
  </h2>
  <p>
    By installing and using Mindful Guard, you acknowledge that 
    this is an Android-based productivity tool designed to 
    enforce digital discipline. You agree to the technical 
    requirements and privacy protocols defined in our documentation.

    2. Technical Implementation
  </h2>
  <p>
    Mindful Guard utilizes Android's <strong>Accessibility 
    Services</strong> and <strong>Usage Access</strong> permissions 
    to function. You acknowledge that:
  </p>
  <ul class="mt-6 space-y-4 list-none text-base">
    <li class="flex gap-4">
      <span class="text-blue-600 font-black">/</span>
      <p>These services are used <strong>exclusively</strong> for app-blocking and session enforcement.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="flex gap-4">
      <span class="text-blue-600 font-black">/</span>
      <p>All processing occurs <strong>entirely on-device</strong> with zero cloud telemetry.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="flex gap-4">
      <span class="text-blue-600 font-black">/</span>
      <p>The app requires local storage permissions for performance and icon caching.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

    3. No-Bypass Warning
  </h2>
  <p>
    The "Strict Logic Mode" is engineered to be 
    absolute. You acknowledge that once a focus session is active, 
    bypassing the blocking protocols is technically impossible 
    by design. AppLass is not liable for your inability to 
    access blocked applications during an active session.

    warranty. While we strive for 100% logic reliability, we 
    are not responsible for any indirect or consequential damages 
    resulting from the use or inability to use the application.
